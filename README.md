## :cyclone: **Project Setup**

To get started with the project locally on your machine.
The first thing you need to do is to clone the repository into your local machine.

```bash
  # Clone the application to your local machine
  foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/jackfros-glitch/Novacrust.git
```

### :snail: Local Setup

To set this up on your machine, make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com) installed on your local machine. After establishing that you have NodeJS installed, navigate into the cloned project directory and follow the steps below:

```bash
  # Navigate into the client directory
  foo@bar:~$ cd Novacrust/nova-checkout

  # Install the packages
  foo@bar:~$ pnpm install

  # Run the application in development
  foo@bar:~$ pnpm run dev
```
